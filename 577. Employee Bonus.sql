ANSWER:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT e.name,b.bonus#selecting name and bonus list from both tables
FROM Employee e#from employee table
LEFT JOIN Bonus b#Because we also need employees who dont have a bonus.
ON e.empID=b.empID#Match employees with their bonuses using the common column
WHERE b.bonus<1000#where bonus is less than 1000
OR b.bonus IS NULL;#return that aswell
